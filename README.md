# Loan_Approval_Prediction_ML-Project Overview
 
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) with a Random Forest Classifier to predict loan approval status based on applicant financial attributes. The model processes real-world data, cleans and prepares it, trains a classifier, and evaluates performance.
By automating loan approval predictions, this project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reportingâ€”essential skills in data science and Machine Learning.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
   pandas, numpy (Data Handling)
   scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
   json (Report Formatting)
ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Data Source: Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset (from Kaggle)
